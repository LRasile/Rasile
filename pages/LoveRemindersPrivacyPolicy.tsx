            <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
            <p>
              Welcome to Love Reminders ("we," "our," or "the app"). We respect your privacy and are committed to
              protecting your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use
              our mobile application.

            <h2>2. Information Collection and Storage</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Current Practice:</strong> Love Reminders currently stores all information locally on your device.
              We do not collect, transmit, or store any of your personal data on external servers. This includes:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Reminder content and notes</li>
              <li>Dates and times you set for reminders</li>
              <li>Any photos or media you add to reminders</li>
              <li>App settings and preferences</li>
              <li>Any other data you input into the app</li>
            </ul>
            <p>All data remains exclusively on your device and is only accessible to you through the app.</p>
          </div>

          <div className="mb-4">
            <h2>3. Data Usage</h2>
            <p>
              The information you create within Love Reminders is used solely for the purpose of providing reminder
              functionality to you. We do not access, analyze, or use your data for any other purpose.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="mb-4">
            <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
            <p>
              Since all data is stored locally on your device, the security of your information depends on your device's
              security measures. We recommend:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Keeping your device locked with a secure password or biometric authentication</li>
              <li>Keeping your device's operating system updated</li>
              <li>Being cautious about who has access to your device</li>
            </ul>
          </div>

          <div className="mb-4">
            <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>
              Love Reminders currently does not integrate with any third-party services or analytics platforms. We do
              not share your data with third parties.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="mb-4">
            <h2>6. Notifications</h2>
            <p>
              The app uses your device's local notification system to deliver reminders. These notifications are
              generated locally on your device and do not involve any external servers.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="mb-4">
            <h2>7. Data Deletion</h2>
            <p>
              You can delete any or all of your data at any time directly within the app. If you uninstall the app, all
              data stored locally will be removed from your device according to your device's operating system behavior.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="mb-4">
            <h2>8. Children's Privacy</h2>

              audiences and can be used by anyone with appropriate parental guidance.
